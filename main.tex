\chapter*{Preface}
In the journey of exploring our past and understanding our roots, \emph{World History in Brief - WHiB - Version x.x} aspires to be more than just another historical account. This book strives to foster collaborative history-making, breaking the traditional mold and inviting readers to be active participants. With this preface, we delve into the essence of this project, its vision, and how it strives to redefine how we view history. Note that this book has very few references. The reader is encouraged to use resources available on the Web to fact check. This book's view on ``causation'' and facts is heavily influenced by Mosteller and Tukey \cite{mosteller1977}.

\section*{Redefining the Role of the Reader}
Historical narratives have traditionally been written in a didactic manner; historians present their research, analysis, and conclusions with an authoritative tone. In these setups, readers play a passive role, absorbing the information and accepting the narratives laid out before them. WHiB challenges this norm, emphasizing that every reader brings a unique perspective to the table and may choose different facts to include if the reader were in fact writing the book. By transforming readers from passive consumers to potentially active participants, the history presented in WHiB can become a collaborative, living, breathing entity, evolving with each reader's input and insights.

\section*{The Collaborative History-Making Vision}
The concept of collaborative history-making is not just about making readers more engaged; it is about decentralizing the power structures inherent in historical writing. For too long, history has been told from a singular, often academic, perspective. By welcoming diverse viewpoints, WHiB seeks to create a platform that allows a diverse presentation in the way historical accounts are written and presented. When history is a shared endeavor, it becomes richer, more nuanced, and representative of humanity's multifaceted experiences.

\section*{Encouraging Critical Thinking and Fact-Checking}
The limited references in WHiB are not an oversight but a deliberate choice. By doing so, the book challenges readers to actively verify information and seek out multiple sources. In the age of the Internet, with a plethora of resources available at one's fingertips, readers have the tools to corroborate or refute historical claims. This not only deepens the reader's understanding but also hones critical thinking skills. In a world where misinformation spreads rapidly, cultivating these skills is imperative.

\section*{Bridging Past and Present}
While WHiB focuses on historical events, its broader aim is to bridge the gap between past and present. By understanding the historical context of contemporary issues, readers can better navigate the complexities of today's globalized world. Every chapter, while rooted in the past, offers insights and parallels relevant to current events, urging readers to reflect on the important lessons to be learned from history and the potentially useful patterns that emerge over time.

\section*{A Dynamic Relationship with History}
\emph{World History in Brief} is not just a book but a movement and methodology, heralding a new era in how we approach, consume, and interact with history. By positioning the reader as an integral part of the historical process, WHiB fosters a dynamic relationship with the past, making history more accessible, inclusive, and relevant. In this shifting paradigm, we are all potential historians, curators of our collective memories and architects of our shared future.

The beauty of open-source lies in its democratization of content creation. In this section, we demystify the process of "forking" on GitHub, guiding you step-by-step on how to take WHiB and create a version uniquely yours.

Understanding Forking

Before diving into the specifics, it's crucial to understand what "forking" means in the context of GitHub. In the simplest terms, to "fork" a project means to create a personal copy of someone else's project. This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forking is akin to taking a book you admire and making a copy to write your notes, edits, or additional chapters without altering the original book.

Why Fork?

Experimentation: It provides a safe space where you can test out ideas, make changes, or introduce new content.

Personalization: For projects like WHiB, it allows readers to customize the content, tailor it to their perspectives, or even localize it for specific audiences.

Collaboration: If you believe your changes have broad appeal, you can propose that they be incorporated back into the original project, enriching it with your unique contributions.

Step-by-Step Forking Guide

Set Up Your GitHub Account: If you don't have an account on GitHub, you'll need to create one. Visit GitHub's official site and sign up.

Navigate to the WHiB Repository: Once logged in, search for the WHiB project or navigate to its URL directly.

Click the 'Fork' Button: Located at the top right corner of the repository page, this button will create a copy of WHiB in your account.

Clone Your Forked Repository: This allows you to have a local copy on your computer, making editing and experimentation easier. Use the command: git clone [URL of your forked repo].

Make Your Changes: Using your preferred tools, introduce the edits, additions, or modifications you desire.

Commit and Push Changes: Once satisfied, save these changes (known as a "commit") and then "push" them to your forked repository on GitHub.

Optional – Create a Pull Request: If you believe your changes should be incorporated into the original WHiB repository, you can create a "pull request." This notifies the original authors of your suggestions.

Things to Keep in Mind

Stay Updated: The original WHiB project may undergo updates. It's a good practice to regularly "pull" from the original repo to keep your fork up-to-date.

Engage with the Community: Open-source thrives on community interactions. Engage in discussions, seek feedback, and always remain open to constructive criticism.

Conclusion: Embracing the Forking Culture

Forking is more than just a technical process; it symbolizes the ethos of open-source — a world where knowledge is not hoarded but shared, refined, and built upon collectively. By forking WHiB or any other project, you're not just creating a personal copy; you're becoming a part of a global movement that values collaboration, innovation, and the shared pursuit of knowledge. So, embark on this journey, make your unique mark, and contribute to the ever-evolving tapestry of collective wisdom.

\chapter{World Population Since 1700}
\subsection*{A Dramatic Increase in World Population}
The World has seen a dramatic increase in population since 1700. This chapter looks at a few countries and discusses whether the ideas of Malthus are relevant in today's world.

\let\oldsection\section
\renewcommand{\section}[1]{\oldsection*{#1}\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{#1}}

\input{world.tex}



Before we go back millions of years in time, let's take a quick look at Earth's population. The population of the world has grown exponentially, more than tripling in the 20th century alone. This growth has been uneven across different regions, influenced by factors such as industrialization, healthcare advancements, and social changes. The idea of Malthus, that population growth would eventually outstrip food production and lead to mass starvation, has not been realized on a global scale. However, pressure on natural resources and the environmental impact of such growth are pressing concerns that need to be addressed.

The population dynamics in the countries mentioned provide a microcosm of global trends and highlight the diversity of experiences in different parts of the world. The challenges of managing such growth are manifold, touching on issues of sustainability, environmental protection, and quality of life.  The world's population is projected to stabilize by the end of the 21st century. Whether this is true remains to be seen. Aging populations, urbanization, and a declining environment are among the key issues that will shape the future. 

Before going way back to early hominins let's take a quick look at pre-modern and modern histories of countries and regions around the world. When we look at hominins, we will be looking at life on earth millions of years ago; truly ancient times. The pre-modern histories that we will now look at may feel ancient to the modern person, but in reality these times are actually quite "modern" compared life millions of years ago when hominins such as "Lucy" - The Australopithecus afarensis, roamed the earth. 

\chapter{Understanding Date Formats}
\section*{A Note about Dates}
Dates can be confusing because of different formatting conventions. How dates are commonly presented will be described in this chapter.

\subsection*{Describing a Date: Examples}
In terms of describing a date these are all the same:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In 1977, going to a movie theater was popular entertainment in the USA.

    \item In 200 BCE, the Roman Empire was a major power.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The History of Date Nomenclature: Understanding BC, AD, BCE, and CE}
Date nomenclature has been a crucial aspect of historical studies, helping scholars, researchers, and the general public to navigate through time and understand the chronology of events. The terms BC, AD, BCE, and CE are central to this nomenclature, each carrying specific meanings and implications. In this essay, we will delve into the history of these terms, their meanings, and how to interpret them.

\subsubsection*{BC and AD: The Christian Calendar}
\paragraph{BC: Before Christ}
The term ``BC'' stands for ``Before Christ.'' It is used to denote years before the traditionally accepted year of Jesus Christ’s birth. In this dating system, years count backward from the supposed year of Jesus’s birth. For example, 500 BC means 500 years before the birth of Christ. It’s worth noting that there is no ``Year 0'' in this system; the year immediately before 1 AD is 1 BC.

\paragraph{AD: Anno Domini}
``AD'' stands for ``Anno Domini,'' which is Latin for ``In the Year of Our Lord.'' This term is used to denote years following the birth of Jesus Christ. For example, AD 500 refers to 500 years after the birth of Christ. AD is typically placed before the year number (e.g., AD 2021), unlike BC, which is placed after the year number.

The AD/BC system was devised by Dionysius Exiguus in the 6th century as a means to establish a Christian chronology for calculating Easter dates. However, modern scholarship has concluded that Jesus was likely born a few years earlier than AD 1, possibly between 4 and 6 BC.

\subsubsection*{BCE and CE: Secularizing the Calendar}
\paragraph{BCE: Before Common Era}
``BCE'' stands for ``Before Common Era.'' It is the secular equivalent of BC, used to denote years before the start of the Common Era (which corresponds with the traditional year of Jesus’s birth). For example, 500 BCE means 500 years before the Common Era. Like BC, there is no ``Year 0'' in this system.

\paragraph{CE: Common Era}
``CE'' stands for ``Common Era,'' a secular term that corresponds to AD in the Christian dating system. It is used to denote years after the start of the Common Era. For example, CE 2021 refers to 2021 years after the start of the Common Era. Like AD, CE is typically placed before the year number.

The use of BCE/CE has become increasingly common in scholarly, academic, and secular contexts, as it avoids the religious connotations of BC/AD and provides a more inclusive and neutral terminology.

\subsection*{How to Interpret These Terms}
Understanding these terms is crucial for accurately interpreting historical dates and contexts. Here’s a quick guide:

\begin{itemize}
    \item BC/BCE: Used for years before the Common Era/Christ’s birth. Counts backward as you go further into the past.
    \item AD/CE: Used for years after the Common Era/Christ’s birth. Counts forward as you move into the future.
\end{itemize}

In sum, the history of date nomenclature reflects both religious influences and the push for secular inclusivity. BC and AD root the calendar in the Christian tradition, while BCE and CE offer a neutral alternative. Knowing how to interpret these terms is essential for navigating historical timelines and understanding the chronology of past events.

\chapter{Early Human History Key Discoveries}
\subsection*{Landmark Finds that Shaped Our Understanding}
The story of hominins is told through fragments - bones, tools, and fossilized footprints. Each discovery adds a piece to the puzzle of our past. This section highlights the groundbreaking discoveries that have reshaped our understanding of early human history.

1. "Lucy" - The Australopithecus afarensis

In 1974, in the Afar region of Ethiopia, anthropologists unearthed the partial skeleton of a hominin who lived around 3.2 million years ago. Dubbed "Lucy," this specimen provided concrete evidence of bipedalism, suggesting that our ancestors were walking upright well before the evolution of larger brains.

2. Homo habilis and the Oldowan Tools

The discovery of Homo habilis remains in the 1960s, alongside simple stone tools known as Oldowan tools, marked an essential chapter in human evolution. This species, with its slightly larger brain than earlier hominins, was aptly named "handy man" and is considered the earliest toolmaker.

3. "Turkana Boy" - The Most Complete Early Human Skeleton

Found near Lake Turkana in Kenya in 1984, the nearly complete skeleton of a Homo erectus youth, often referred to as the "Turkana Boy," gave scientists invaluable insights into the physical stature, growth patterns, and other anatomical features of an early human species that existed almost 1.6 million years ago.

4. The Footprints of Laetoli

In Tanzania, a set of fossilized footprints discovered in 1978 captured a moment from 3.6 million years ago when three Australopithecus afarensis individuals walked through wet volcanic ash. These footprints, preserved at Laetoli, confirmed the bipedal nature of these early hominins.

5. Neanderthal DNA Sequencing

Neanderthals, our closest extinct relatives, once inhabited parts of Europe and Asia. The sequencing of the Neanderthal genome in 2010 not only provided insights into their biology and relationship with modern humans but also revealed that non-African modern humans share a small percentage of their DNA with Neanderthals, pointing to ancient interbreeding events.

6. The Discovery of Homo naledi

In 2013, inside South Africa's Rising Star cave system, researchers uncovered a treasure trove of bones belonging to a previously unknown hominin species named Homo naledi. This species, with its mix of primitive and more modern traits, challenged established timelines and theories about human evolution.

7. Homo floresiensis - The "Hobbit" of Human Evolution

On the Indonesian island of Flores, the discovery of a diminutive hominin species, Homo floresiensis, in 2004 baffled scientists. Often called the "Hobbit," this species, which stood just about 3.5 feet tall, lived as recently as 50,000 years ago and might have overlapped with modern humans.

8. Denisovans - A Mysterious Sister Group

While Neanderthals have been known for quite some time, the discovery of a finger bone and a couple of teeth in Siberia's Denisova Cave in 2010 unveiled the existence of another archaic human group, the Denisovans. Genetic analysis has shown that they too interbred with both Neanderthals and modern humans.

Conclusion: Piecing Together the Hominin Puzzle

The search for our roots is a journey that takes us through time, across continents, and deep into cave systems. Every discovery, whether it's a single tooth or a near-complete skeleton, sheds light on the intricate mosaic of human evolution. By studying these finds, scientists and historians not only map out our shared ancestry but also unravel the complex interplay of biology, environment, and culture that defines the human story.
